# pybaseball

## 2.2.1 Release: April 27, 2021

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

`pybaseball` is a Python package for baseball data analysis. This package scrapes Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and FanGraphs so you don't have to. The package retrieves statcast data, pitching stats, batting stats, division standings/team records, awards data, and more. Data is available at the individual pitch level, as well as aggregated at the season level and over custom time periods. See the [docs](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/tree/master/docs) for a comprehensive list of data acquisition functions.

## Installation

Pybaseball can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install pybaseball
```

or from the repo (which may at times be more up to date):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball
cd pybaseball
pip install -e .
```

We will try to publish periodic updates through the 'releases' and PyPI CI, but it may lag at times.

## Statcast: Pull advanced metrics from Major League Baseball's Statcast system

Statcast data include pitch-level features such as Perceived Velocity (PV), Spin Rate (SR), Exit Velocity (EV), pitch X, Y, and Z coordinates, and more. The function `statcast(start_dt, end_dt)` pulls this data from baseballsavant.com. 

```python
>>> from pybaseball import statcast
>>> data = statcast(start_dt='2017-06-24', end_dt='2017-06-27')
>>> data.head(2)

   index pitch_type  game_date  release_speed  release_pos_x  release_pos_z

[2 rows x 79 columns]
```

If `start_dt` and `end_dt` are supplied, it will return all statcast data between those two dates. If not, it will return yesterday's data. The optional argument `verbose` will control whether the library updates you on its progress while it pulls the data.

For a player-specific statcast query, pull pitching or batting data using the `statcast_pitcher` and `statcast_batter` functions. These take the same `start_dt` and `end_dt` arguments as the statcast function, as well as a `player_id` argument. This ID comes from MLB Advanced Media, and can be obtained using the function `playerid_lookup`. A complete example: 

```python
>>> # Find Clayton Kershaw's player id
>>> from pybaseball import playerid_lookup
>>> from pybaseball import statcast_pitcher
>>> playerid_lookup('kershaw', 'clayton')
Gathering player lookup table. This may take a moment.

   mlb_played_first  mlb_played_last
0            2008.0           2017.0

>>> # His MLBAM ID is 477132, so we feed that as the player_id argument to the following function 
>>> kershaw_stats = statcast_pitcher('2017-06-01', '2017-07-01', 477132)
>>> kershaw_stats.head(2)

### A note on Statcast data

Statcast data is subject to change (even for prior seasons):

<div>
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
      <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
         Each season has 700,000+ pitches, and is subject to update. You should code accordingly.

## Pitching Stats: pitching stats for players across multiple seasons, single seasons, or during a specified time period

This library contains two main functions for obtaining pitching data. For league-wide season-level pitching data, use the function `pitching_stats(start_season, end_season)`. This will return one row per player per season, and provide all metrics made available by FanGraphs.

The second is `pitching_stats_range(start_dt, end_dt)`. This allows you to obtain pitching data over a specific time interval, allowing you to get more granular than the FanGraphs function (for example, to see which pitcher had the strongest month of May). This query pulls data from Baseball Reference. Note that all dates should be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

If you prefer Baseball Reference to FanGraphs, there is a third option called `pitching_stats_bref(season)`. This works the same as `pitching_stats`, but retrieves its data from Baseball Reference instead. This is typically not recommended, however, because the Baseball Reference query currently can only retrieve one season's worth of data per request.

```python
>>> from pybaseball import pitching_stats
>>> data = pitching_stats(2012, 2016)
>>> data.head()
     Season             Name     Team   Age     W    L   ERA  WAR     G    GS

## Batting Stats: hitting stats for players within seasons or during a specified time period

Batting stats are obtained similar to pitching stats. The function call for getting a season-level stats is `batting_stats(start_season, end_season)`, and for a particular time range it is `batting_stats_range(start_dt, end_dt)`. The Baseball Reference equivalent for season-level data is `batting_stats_bref(season)`. 

```python
>>> from pybaseball import batting_stats_range
>>> data = batting_stats_range('2017-05-01', '2017-05-08')
>>> data.head()
          Name  Age  #days     Lev          Tm  G  PA  AB  R  H  ...    HBP

## Game-by-Game Results and Schedule 
The `schedule_and_record` function returns a team's game-by-game results for a given season, including game date, home and away teams, end result (W/L/Tie), score, winning/losing/saving pitchers, attendance, and division standing at that date. The function's only two arguments are `season` and `team`, where team is the team's abbreviation (i.e. NYY for New York Yankees, SEA for Seattle Mariners). If the season argument is set to the current season, the query returns results for past games and the schedule for those that have not occurred yet. 

```python
# Example: Let's take a look at the individual-game results of the 1927 Yankees
>>> from pybaseball import schedule_and_record
>>> data = schedule_and_record(1927, 'NYY')
>>> data.head()
                Date   Tm Home_Away  Opp W/L     R   RA   Inn  W-L  Rank  \
1    Tuesday, Apr 12  NYY      Home  PHA   W   8.0  3.0   9.0  1-0   1.0

```


## Standings: up to date or historical division standings, W/L records

The `standings(season)` function gives division standings for a given season. If the current season is chosen, it will give the most current set of standings. Otherwise, it will give the end-of-season standings for each division for the chosen season. 

This function returns a list of dataframes. Each dataframe is the standings for one of MLB's six divisions. 

```python
>>> from pybaseball import standings
>>> data = standings(2016)[4]
>>> print(data)
                    Tm    W   L  W-L%    GB
1         Chicago Cubs  103  58  .640    --
2  St. Louis Cardinals   86  76  .531  17.5
3   Pittsburgh Pirates   78  83  .484  25.0
4    Milwaukee Brewers   73  89  .451  30.5
5      Cincinnati Reds   68  94  .420  35.5
```

# Caching

To facilitate faster data retrieval for repeated calls, a local data cache may be used to save a local copy of the
requested data. By default the cache is disabled so as to respect a user's potential desire to not have their hard drive
space used without their permission. However, enabling the cache is simple.

Cache can be turned on by including the pybaseball.cache module and enabling the cache option like so:

```python
from pybaseball import cache

cache.enable()
```

# Troubleshooting

If you're getting a error with `concurrent.futures.process.BrokenProcessPool`, wrap your call in a main function, e.g.

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    stats = statcast()
```

This may be necessary on systems that use spawn-based processes (often Windows and OSX). 

For other problems, please submit an issue.

# Complete Documentation

So far this has provided a basic overview of what this package can do and how you can use it. For full documentation on available functions and their arguments, see the [docs](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/tree/master/docs) folder.

## Credit

This package was developed by James LeDoux and is maintained by [Moshe Schorr](https://github.com/schorrm).

This package was inspired by Bill Petti's excellent R package [baseballr](https://github.com/billpetti/baseballr), which at the time of this package's development had no Python equivalent. Our hope is to fill that void with this package.

The Lahman data comes from [Sean Lahman's baseball database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/).

All other data comes from FanGraphs, Baseball Reference, the Chadwick Bureau, Retrosheet, and Baseball Savant.

## Work in Progress:

Moving forward, we intend to:

* Implement custom metrics such as Statcast edge percentages, historical Elo ratings, wOBA, etc.
* Retrieve data from other useful sources
* Identify edge cases where these queries fail (please open up an issue if you find one!)
* Add more examples
