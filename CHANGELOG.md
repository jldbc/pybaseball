## Release Notes

We have a lot of new stuff in this release.

- Caching
   - We now cache most of the time expensive scraping functions. In addition, we have a consistent storage location for the Lahman Databank, so no more five copies of baseball-databank. This is currently disabled by default, you can enable it (see caching in the docs).
   - Basically, now when you call something like `batting_stats(2018)`, for a while subsequent calls will just hit the cache, if it is enabled, so you don't need to do a bunch of pd.load and df.to_csv all over your notebooks.
   - Right now this is a week by default, which is configurable in code, and will probably change soon to more specific per-function staleness. @TheCleric, @schorrm
