# Team Batting

`team_batting(start_season, end_season=None, league='all', ind=1)`

The team_batting function returns a dataframe of team-level batting stats. This can be for either a single season or multiple. If multiple seasons are involved, this function can provide either single-season stats (e.g. one row per team per season) or aggregate stats over all seasons (e.g. each team's total HR, RBI, etc. over all seasons queried). 

## Arguments
`start_season:` Integer. The first season for which you want the league's team-level batting data.

`end_season:` Integer. The last season for which you want the league's team-level batting data. If not provided, the query will return data for only the `start_season`.  

`league:` String. Either "all", "nl", or "al" for determining whether you want data from one league or both. Defaults to "all", for returning data on all teams. 

`ind:` Integer. Flag for whether you want data to be returned at the individual-season or aggregate level. If `ind=1`, returns one row per team per year. If `ind=0`, the query aggregates the data so that one row of aggregate stats is provided per team. For example, `team_batting(2010, 2012, ind=1)` would return 90 rows, one for each team's 2010, 2011, and 2012 stats, while `team_batting(2010, 2012, ind=0)` would return 30 rows, one for each team's aggregate 2010-2012 batting performance.

## Examples of valid queries

```python
from pybaseball import team_batting

# get each team's seasonal batting stats from 2010 through 2013
data = team_batting(2010, 2013)

# get each team's aggregate batting stats from 2010 through 2013
data = team_batting(2010, 2013, ind=0)

# get team batting stats for only the 1999 season
data = team_batting(1999)
```
