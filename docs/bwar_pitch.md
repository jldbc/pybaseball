# Bwar Pitching

`bwar_pitch(return_all=False)`

Get Baseball Reference's WAR stats from its `war_daily_pitch` table, along with some other data that's not included in the `pitching_stats_bref()` function. 

## Arguments
`return_all` Bool. Returns all fields from `war_daily_pitch` table if True, returns only a subset of columns if False. Defaults to False because most fields aren't needed for standard use cases.
