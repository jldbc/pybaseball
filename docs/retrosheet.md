# Retrosheet

The functions in `retrosheet.py` retrieve game logs, rosters, schedules, park codes and event files by Retrosheet from [the Chadwick Bureau Github](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/retrosheet).

## Extra Setup (Optional)

When pulling retrosheet data, the request is checked against the files in the Chadwick Bureau retrosheet Github repository. The Github API has a rate limit of 60 queries per hour for non-registered queries. To register your connection and raise your rate limit to 5000 queries per hour, follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) once you've signed up for a Github account. On a MAC/Linux system, add `GH_TOKEN=<your_token>` to your `.bashrc` file. On Windows, add `GH_TOKEN` to your environment variables via the Start menu.

Note this isn't required, but will provide you with more instructive errors as your queries will be checked against existing files before downloading.
