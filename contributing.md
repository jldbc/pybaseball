# Contributing

We welcome pull requests improving any aspect of this library. All we ask is that you describe the change you're proposing in detail and that you run some tests on your own end before submitting (are the results as you would expect them to be? Any edge cases that would break this?)

Here's a short list of ideas if you want to contribute.

* Grabbing additional data sources from trusted sites (FanGraphs, Baseball Reference, etc.). Write a function that scrapes the data and returns it in a usable format.
* Fix an error or broken request/scrape in the existing code
* Refactoring and style improvements
* Documentation / README improvements
* Custom statistical functions. Something for calculating ELO, for example, could be interesting.
* Custom visualization and data preparation tools (e.g. a function for getting a player's spraychart for a set season/date range)
* Share some example code. If you've done something cool with pybaseball, I'd love to include it in the EXAMPLES folder in the form of a Jupyter notebook.
